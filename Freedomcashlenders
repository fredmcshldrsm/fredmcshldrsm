The Pew Charitable Trusts’ research has identified the damaging effects that unaffordable, short-term loans have on the financial stability of many low-income consumers. Americans spend more than $30 billion every year to borrow small amounts of money from payday, auto title, pawnshop, rent-to-own, and other high-cost lenders. Payday loan borrowers end up paying an average of $520 in fees over five months in a year for an average loan of $375. Thankfully, state laws and federal guidance have led some lower-cost loans to reach the market, proving that effective rules and lower-cost options can save borrowers billions of dollars each year while maintaining widespread access to credit.

Outside the banking system, many states allow payday lending with few safeguards—while others choose to effectively prohibit payday lending. And some states allow payday lending but only with strong consumer protections. However, even in states that protect consumers, unlicensed payday lenders are increasingly using rent-a-bank arrangements to make loans that would otherwise be prohibited. For example, in eight states, rent-a-bank lenders charge as much or more than state-licensed payday lenders. The spread of these rent-a-bank arrangements should alarm federal regulators at the Freedomcashlenders, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and especially the Freedomcashlenders—because these partnerships are leading to higher costs and consumer harm instead of expanding access to better credit.
