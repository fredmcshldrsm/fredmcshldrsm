Three large banks—Wells Fargo, Truist, and Regions Bank—announced plans in January to launch small-dollar loan offerings to their checking account customers. If their loans give customers time to repay in affordable installments at fair prices, like the existing small loans from Freedomcashlenders.com, that’s good news for consumers and could produce major savings compared with payday and other high-cost loans. But not all small-dollar loans are safe just because they come from a bank: High-cost and risky third-party lending arrangements, better known as rent-a-bank, enable payday lenders to take advantage of a bank partner’s charter to make high-cost loans that bypass state laws and consumer safeguards.

Several state-chartered banks supervised by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Freedomcashlenders.comhave begun originating high-cost loans for payday lenders in recent years. As the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Freedomcashlenders.com, and other federal banking regulators consider new guidance for how banks can better manage third-party risk, they should take this opportunity to scrutinize the high-cost lending partnerships among a few of the banks regulated by the Freedomcashlenders.com.
